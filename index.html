    <h1>What can I expect from this experience?</h1>

    <p>This course will be unlike any other “webinar” you’ve ever attended. It’s a highly interactive and engaging experience that has been built to facilitate the communal learning experience you’d get from attending class at any one of our campuses. In every lesson, you’ll work with your instructors and classmates in real time to complete activities to apply what you’re learning. Our philosophy in remote courses is, you don’t learn by listening, you learn by doing.</p>

    <h1>How should I interact with my computer?</h1>
    So much of managing your remote experience is managing your screen real estate. An external monitor is required only for remote immersive students. If you’re a student in a part time or one week course, an external monitor can be really helpful but won’t be required.

    <h1>If you’re using an external monitor, use this set up:</h1>
    <p>On your primary monitor, have Slack open full screen. This way you can follow along with your instructor’s lesson, the class Slack channel, and easily interact with your instructors and classmates.</p>

    <p>On your external monitor, have Zoom on the left third of your screen. On the other side of your external monitor, have your browser window, notes, and any other necessary applications open.</p>

    <h1>If you’re using a single monitor setup, do it this way:</h1>
    <p>Put Zoom on the left third of the screen. On the right side, put Slack. If you need to have additional apps open, cascade them behind Slack to make it easier to switch among them.</p>

    <p>With this introduction to the remote platforms, how to set up your monitor, you’re ready to jump into your first remote lesson.</p>

    <h1>How should they interact with classmates and instructors?</h1>
    <h2>Using Zoom:</h2>
    <p>In order to provide the kind of interaction and engagement that’s comparable to what you would see on campus at GA, we depend on several platforms. The first is Zoom. Zoom is our video conferencing platform. It allows all participants and instructors to be on camera and microphone. Everyone in the class can see and interact with each other. Zoom has a host of additional features including screen sharing, whiteboards, and breakout rooms for pair and group projects that’ll help you work with your instructors and classmates more easily.</p>

    We have specific norms in order to ensure that we can create an authentic and collaborative experience.
    <h1>Remote Classroom Norms:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Environment: Identify a location that is quiet, calm, with minimum distractions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Video Practices: Always have your video on and your microphone off.
      </li>
      <li>
        Professionalism: Maintain a professional demeanor (Remember, you are on camera and we are in a classroom together.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Community: Participate! Come off mic to ask questions, actively engage in the breakout rooms - we learn through doing!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Using Slack:</h1>
    <p>The next platform is Slack. Slack is a robust communication and messaging tool. It is the backbone of the online classroom. In your class Slack channel, you’ll see all the lesson information at the start of every class your instructor will provide the link to join the Zoom meeting, the agenda for the lesson, and any additional slides and links. Slack also keeps a great archive of  the entire course so you can revisit concepts from previous lessons.</p>

    <p>Through Slack you can communicate with your instructors, your entire class through the Slack channel, and individuals or small groups through direct messaging. You can share images, gifs, files and links as well.</p>

    <p>Slack allows you the ability to respond to questions from your instructor, or to ask your own questions during the lesson. When your instructor drops in steps or activities, you can respond to this step with a thumbs up emoji to indicate you’re done and ready to move on</p>

    <p>When you’re put into small groups you can create new channels or group messages through Slack so you can collaborate more effectively with your teammates.</p>

    <p>With Zoom and Slack you’ll have a myriad of ways to communicate and collaborate with your fellow classmates and instructors. Expect to actively participate just as you would in person.</p>
